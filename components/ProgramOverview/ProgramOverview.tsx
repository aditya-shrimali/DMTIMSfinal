            <p>
              Any student who has completed a two year full time post graduate
              program/course from a recognised/approved institute or university.
              If the specialisation of International MBA opted for is same as
              that of the post graduate degree, then the student may note that
              the International MBA degree will be conferred through direct
              credit transfer of the post graduate degree specialization and
              thus, the need to take up the same specialization in the
              International MBA does not arise. If, the International MBA
              specialization differs from the PGDM program's specialization, the
              student must submit a separate dissertation of additional 60
              credits, in the MBA specialization subject.
